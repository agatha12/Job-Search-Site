Worked as a team to creat an interactive job search
website that calls to multiple APIs (AuthenticJobs, Twitter, GitHub Jobs, and the News API). The site displays the results in two containers on the page and creates multiple buttons that reveal 
information about the various positions. One of the buttons calls 
the Twitter API and displays tweats about the company which is 
advertising that particular position. There is also a page which searches The News API for recent articles about jobs and displays links to those articles. We also included a community section for additional support for job hunters.
